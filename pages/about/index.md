90 years ago a few Japanese American farming families from Gardena Valley in California
founded the Gardena Buddhist Church. In the years since, the Sangha has grown
to over 500 families. Today, technology has enabled us to share with you the
activities, thoughts and history of our Sangha as we spread the Nembutsu beyond
our traditional geographical boundaries. We hope you enjoy what we have to
offer.

Gardena Buddhist Church offers various religious and social activities centered around the family.
While members are primarily of Japanese-American ancenstry, people of all backgrounds are welcome
to join us in learning the Dharma and sharing in our community.
